# Optimization and Text Classification

## Description

Through this project, wish to gain some insight into the optimization process of gradient based methods. In particular, through implementing different variations of gradient descent on logistic regression and analyze their impact on the convergence speed. In the second, experimented with text data and explore text-specific preprocessing techniques, and to reapply concepts such as cross-validation that are central to machine learning. 

### Result

Through training and testing various logistic regression implementations with different hyper param-eters, we found the best model with highest accuracies and saw the correlation between increase intest accuracy and convergence speed and decrease in mini batch size.  By adding momentum to gra-dient descent, it helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions.  Through usage of librariesand different implementations of hyperparameters and features for text classification, we are able todiscover a best model and improve test accuracy to 76.9%
